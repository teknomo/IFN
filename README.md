# IFN
Ideal Flow is a steady state relative flow distribution in a strongly connected network where the flows are conserved. The IFN theory was proposed by Kardi Teknomo in 2015 and subsequently developed by his team. Ideal Flow is a new concept to analyze transportation networks or communication network. For IFN application to traffic assignment check IFN-Transport for more details.
